# My Website

This is my personal website! 

It contains various pieces of information about me, some things I've done, and how you can contact me.

I made it using the [Astro](https://astro.build) javascript framework (which is converted to static HTML to be hosted by GitHub pages) and the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS library.

If you want to view old versions of this site, you can find them at [both](https://web.archive.org/web/20241201000000*/gaminglizard9.github.io) of [these](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/dawsoncall.com) Internet Archive links.
