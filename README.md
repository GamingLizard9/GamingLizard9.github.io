This is my personal website!

It contains various pieces of information about me, some things I've done, and how you
can contact me.

I gave the site a complete redesign in April of 2025; if you still want to see the old
versions, they are on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20241201000000*/gaminglizard9.github.io) at [one of these two links](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/dawsoncall.com).

I made this page using the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS framework.
