        <h1>GamingLizard9's Website</h1>
        <p>Hey! I'm GamingLizard9, and this is my website!</p>
        <p>I am currently redesigning it. This is my placeholder with a simpler layout so you don't have to go through the pain of the old one. If you want the old site, <a href="./index-old.html">click here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are the things I have done:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="./dna/dna.html">DNA Thingy</a></strong>: I made this a long time ago, and haven't updated it since. No guarantee the results are accurate.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://smallsteps-bigdreams.com">Small Steps, Big Dreams</a></strong>: Website for my aunt's preschool.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://sfsband.org">sfsband.org</a></strong>: Website for the SFS band</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://gaminglizard9.github.io/dakboards">Dawson's DAKboards</a></strong>: Work-In-Progress website for a personal business. Probably my best work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the old site for socials.</p>
